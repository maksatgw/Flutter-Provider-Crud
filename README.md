# Flutter Crud App

A simple Flutter application fetching sample data from my own test api. 
Used Dio package for requests.
<br>
Tried to use mvvm pattern and provider package at the same time.
You can make get, post and delete requests in this application. Update feature for datas, error handling, share and bugfixes will be added soon.

## Requirements For Using

You can e-mail me for full api url/key for testing and research purposes.
